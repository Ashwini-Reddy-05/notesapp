# notesapp

This is a simple and user-friendly Notes web application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML file provides the basic structure of the app, including a heading, an “Add Note” button, and a container section where notes are dynamically displayed. The CSS file (notes.css) is used to design an organized and visually appealing layout with styled note cards, buttons, spacing, and responsive design for better user experience. The JavaScript file (notes.js) adds functionality by allowing users to create, edit, and delete notes dynamically. It handles DOM manipulation, event handling, and may use local storage to save notes so that they remain available even after refreshing the page. This project demonstrates essential front-end development concepts such as dynamic content creation, interactive user interfaces, and data persistence in the browser.
